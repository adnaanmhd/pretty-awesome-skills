# Note-taking

## Why Notes Matter

- Without notes, you become a bottleneck—knowledge stuck in your head
- Notes prevent self-deception (harder to lie to yourself about what was said)
- Exact quotes are gold for marketing, fundraising, and convincing skeptical teammates
- Months later, you can revisit insights without re-interviewing

## Symbol System

Use shorthand symbols to capture context quickly. Build your own, but here's a starting set:

### Emotions
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| :) | Excited, happy |
| :( | Angry, frustrated |
| :| | Embarrassed, awkward |
| !!! | Very strong emotion (combine with above) |

**Why capture emotions?** "That's a problem" means different things when said with a shrug vs. with anger. Emotional intensity signals problem severity.

### Their Life
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ☇ | Pain or problem (lightning bolt) |
| ⎯⊙ | Goal or job-to-be-done (target) |
| ☐ | Obstacle blocking them |
| ⤴ | Workaround they've built |
| ^ | Background context |

These are your bread and butter. Combine with emotions: **☇ :(** = painful problem they're angry about.

### Specifics
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ☑ | Feature request or buying criteria |
| $ | Money, budget, purchasing info |
| @ | Specific person or company mentioned |
| ★ | Follow-up task for you |
| "" | Exact quote (write verbatim) |

## What to Write Down

### Always Capture
1. **Exact quotes** - Wrap in quotation marks. Use for marketing, decks, arguments.
2. **Strong emotions** - The WHY behind their feelings
3. **Specific numbers** - Budget, time spent, cost of problem, team size
4. **Names** - People to meet, competitors, tools they use
5. **Surprises** - Anything that challenges your assumptions

### Don't Bother With
- Generic positive feedback ("sounds cool")
- Obvious demographic info (unless segmenting)
- Your own thoughts during the meeting (save for review)

## Note Format Example

```
2024-01-15 | Sarah Chen | Product Lead @ AcmeCorp

^  Team of 8 PMs, use Jira + Notion
☇ :( "We spend 2 HOURS every Monday just syncing spreadsheets"
⤴  Built custom Zapier flows, still breaks weekly
$  Paying intern $20/hr to fix it manually
☑  Must integrate with Jira (non-negotiable)
@  Talk to Mike (their eng lead) - she'll intro
★  Send follow-up with pilot proposal Friday

"I would mass-delete emails to find ONE HOUR to fix this"
```

### Recommended Options

**Index cards / Post-its**
- One quote/insight per card
- Great for team review: spread on table, sort and group
- Add date + name after meeting

**Spreadsheet (Google Sheets)**
- Columns: Date, Name, Company, Segment, Key Quotes, Signals, Follow-ups
- Excellent for filtering and sorting
- Downside: Awkward to use during meeting

**Dedicated tool (Notion, Dovetail, etc.)**
- Good for scaling with team
- Can tag and categorize
- Downside: Setup overhead

## Template: Conversation Notes

```
Date: 
Name: 
Role/Company: 
Segment: 
How we connected: 

## Context
[Background on their situation - 2-3 sentences]

## Key Quotes
- ""
- ""

## Signals
☇ Problems: 
⎯⊙ Goals: 
⤴ Workarounds: 
$ Budget/value: 

## Surprises
[What challenged our assumptions?]

## Follow-ups
★ 
★ 

## Next Steps with This Person
[Commitment they made, or why they're not a customer]
```

## Sharing with Investors/Advisors

When sharing learnings externally:

1. **Lead with quotes** - "8 out of 10 customers said..."
2. **Show patterns** - "Every person over $1M revenue had this problem"
3. **Acknowledge gaps** - "We still need to learn X"
4. **Name specific customers** (with permission) - Credibility matters

**Never say:** "Everyone loves it" or "We're getting great feedback"
**Instead say:** "7 of 10 target customers committed to a pilot, citing [specific reason]"
