# Situation Playbook

## You Accidentally Pitched Your Idea
**What to say:**
> "Whoops—I slipped into pitch mode. Sorry about that. Can we go back to what you were saying? You mentioned [their last point]..."

Then: Return to asking about their life, not your idea.

## They're Giving You Compliments
**Recognize it:**
- "That's really cool!"
- "I love it!"
- "You should definitely build that."

**What to do:**
Deflect and redirect to concrete facts:
> "Thanks! But help me understand—how are you actually dealing with this today?"

**Don't do:**
- Thank them enthusiastically
- Write it down as positive signal
- Use it to convince yourself or investors

## They're Being Wishy-Washy
**Recognize it:**
- "Maybe we could use something like that..."
- "Sounds interesting, keep me posted."
- "Let me know when it launches."

**What to do:**
Push for a concrete commitment:
> "What would it take to get you to try a pilot next month?"
> "Can I schedule time with your team to dig deeper?"

If they won't commit anything (time, reputation, money), they're not a customer—move on.

## They Said "I Would Definitely Buy That"
**The trap:** This feels like validation but is worthless future-tense fluff.

**What to do:**
Convert to present-tense commitment:
> "That's great to hear. What would you need to see to sign a letter of intent today?"
> "Can I send you an invoice for a pre-order?"
> "Who else needs to be involved before you could commit?"

**Remember:** The gap between "would pay" and "actually paying" is massive.

## Cold Outreach
**The challenge:** No credibility, high chance of being ignored.

**Strategy:**
1. Keep asks small: "5 minutes to ask 2 questions"
2. Show you've done homework: "I noticed you [specific thing]"
3. Offer value: "I'm writing a report on [topic] and would love your perspective"
4. Accept 90% rejection as filtering for the right people

**Goal:** Convert cold leads to warm intros. One good conversation leads to three more.

## Casual/Serendipitous Encounters
**The opportunity:** No formal setup means no formal expectations. Pure learning.

**How to do it:**
- Drop your most important question immediately
- No need to explain you're starting a company
- Just be genuinely curious about their work
- 5 minutes of good questions > 1 hour formal meeting

**Example:** At a conference, you hear someone mention your problem space:
> "Hey, I overheard you mention [topic]. I'm really curious—how do you actually deal with that?"

## Formal Meetings
**When necessary:** Selling to enterprises, talking to executives, late-stage validation.

**Structure:**
1. 5 min: Pleasantries and framing
2. 5 min: Your questions to understand their context
3. 10 min: Demo or discussion of solution
4. 5 min: Next steps and commitment
5. 5 min: "Who else should I talk to?"

**Key:** Even in formal meetings, start with learning questions before revealing your idea.

## Group Interviews
**The challenge:** Social dynamics affect honesty. People perform for each other.

**Strategies:**
- Watch for the quiet person who nods—they often have the real insight
- Ask individuals directly: "[Name], what's your experience with this?"
- Watch body language when others speak
- Follow up 1:1 with the most engaged participants

## Expert Interviews
**Purpose:** Understanding industry structure, not validating your problem.

**Good questions:**
- "How does this industry actually work?"
- "What do most people get wrong about this space?"
- "If you were starting a company here, what would you build?"
- "Who are the 3 people I absolutely must talk to?"

**Caution:** Experts know the industry but may be wrong about customer problems. Don't over-weight their opinions.

## They Ask "What Do You Do?"
**Before you're ready to pitch:**
> "We're still figuring it out. Right now I'm just trying to understand how people deal with [problem area]. What's your experience been?"

**Deflect and return focus to them.**

## They Want to Give Feature Requests
**What they say:** "You should add X feature."

**What to do:**
Dig into motivation, don't add to your todo list:
> "Interesting—what would that let you do?"
> "How are you coping without that today?"
> "Would you push back our launch to get that feature?"

**What you learn:** The underlying need, not the proposed solution.

## They Claim the Problem is "Huge" but Haven't Acted
**Red flag:** Emotional complaints without behavior change.

**Test it:**
> "When's the last time this came up?"
> "What did you do about it?"
> "Have you searched for solutions?"

**Reality:** If they haven't looked for solutions, they won't look for (or buy) yours.

## You're Talking to the Wrong Person
**Signs:**
- They can't answer questions about budget
- They say "I'd have to check with..."
- They're enthusiastic but powerless

**What to do:**
> "This is really helpful. To make sure I understand the full picture, who else deals with this decision?"

Get intros to decision-makers and budget-holders.

## They're Not Your Customer (But Are Being Polite)
**Signs:**
- Short, disinterested answers
- "Yeah, that happens" (flat tone)
- No follow-up questions from them
- Won't commit to anything

**What to do:**
Don't try to convince them. Learn what you can and move on:
> "Sounds like this isn't a huge pain point for you. Out of curiosity, what IS the biggest challenge you're dealing with right now?"

You might discover a different, better problem.

## They Love Your Product but Won't Pay
**Diagnosis:** You've built a vitamin, not a painkiller.

**Questions to ask:**
> "What would need to be true for this to be worth paying for?"
> "How much would this need to save you to justify the cost?"
> "Who in your company WOULD pay for this?"

**Hard truth:** If the problem isn't painful enough to pay for, you may need to find a different customer segment or problem.

## Your Feedback Is All Over the Map
**Diagnosis:** Your customer segment is too broad.

**Fix:** Slice narrower. Instead of "small businesses," try "marketing agencies with 5-20 employees who use Slack." Instead of "students," try "PhD students in STEM fields preparing for conference talks."

**Rule:** If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment.

## You Can't Find People to Talk To
**Diagnosis:** Your segment isn't findable, or you're not being creative enough.

**Strategies:**
1. Where do they already gather? (Forums, conferences, Slack groups, subreddits)
2. What have they already tried to solve? (Search for workarounds)
3. Who serves them already? (Partners, adjacent tools, consultants)
4. Can you bring them to you? (Blog, host a meetup, teach a workshop)

## Everyone Says Yes but No One Buys
**Diagnosis:** You're collecting compliments, not commitments.

**Fix:**
- Stop asking "Would you use this?"
- Start asking "Can you give me $X right now?"
- Look for emotional intensity: "THAT IS THE WORST PART OF MY DAY" vs "Yeah, that's a problem"

**Find your earlyvangelists:** People who have the problem, know they have it, have budget, and have already cobbled together their own solution.
