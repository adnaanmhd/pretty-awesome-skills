## Question by purpose

### Problem Discovery (Do They Care?)

Use these when you're still validating whether a problem exists and matters.

**Opening questions:**
- "What are your biggest challenges with [area] right now?"
- "Walk me through a typical day/week dealing with [area]."
- "What's the hardest part of [their job/task]?"

**Digging deeper:**
- "Tell me about the last time that happened."
- "What made that particularly frustrating?"
- "What are the implications when that goes wrong?"
- "Why hasn't this been solved already?"

**Testing importance:**
- "Where does this rank among your priorities?"
- "What would you be able to do if this was solved?"
- "How much time/money does this cost you?"

**Red flag responses:**
- "It's annoying but we deal with it" → Not a must-solve problem
- "I never really thought about it" → Not top of mind
- "We throw interns at it" → Workaround exists, low priority

### Solution Exploration (What Have They Tried?)

Use these to understand their current behavior and existing alternatives.

**Current solutions:**
- "How are you dealing with this right now?"
- "What tools/processes do you use for this?"
- "What do you love and hate about your current approach?"

**Past attempts:**
- "What else have you tried?"
- "Why did you stop using [previous solution]?"
- "What's been the biggest barrier to fixing this?"

**Switching behavior (critical!):**
- "When did you last switch solutions for something like this?"
- "What made you finally decide to switch?"
- "How painful was the transition?"

**Bob Moesta's Four Forces framework:**
- Push: "What's making you want to change?"
- Pull: "What does the ideal solution look like?"
- Anxiety: "What worries you about switching?"
- Habit: "What's comfortable about your current way?"

### Validation & Commitment

Use these when you have a solution concept and need to test real interest.

**Specificity tests:**
- "If this existed today, how would you use it?"
- "Who else would need to be involved in the decision?"
- "What would need to be true for you to try this?"

**Commitment tests:**
- "Would you be willing to try a pilot with your team?"
- "Can I show this to your [boss/team] next week?"
- "Would you pay $X to solve this?" → Then: "Can I invoice you now?"

**Objection mining:**
- "What would make you NOT use this?"
- "What's your biggest concern?"
- "If this failed, what would be the reason?"

### Post-Validation Learning

Use these with existing users or customers to improve and expand.

**Usage patterns:**
- "Walk me through how you used this last week."
- "What feature do you use most? Least?"
- "What workaround have you built around our product?"

**Value confirmation:**
- "What would you do if we disappeared tomorrow?"
- "Have you recommended us to anyone? Why/why not?"
- "What's the #1 thing we've changed for you?"

**Expansion opportunities:**
- "What's the next problem you want solved?"
- "What else does your team struggle with?"
- "Who else in your company has problems like this?"

## Questions for Specific Roles

### For Decision-Makers (Executives, Budget Owners)
- "What's your process for evaluating new tools?"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline for making a change like this?"
- "What would you need to see to feel confident moving forward?"

### For End Users (Day-to-Day Workers)
- "Show me how you do [task] right now."
- "Where do you get frustrated in your workflow?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "What's the thing you wish your boss understood about this?"

### For Technical Buyers (IT, Engineers)
- "What would integration look like?"
- "What are your security/compliance requirements?"
- "How does this fit with your existing stack?"
- "What's failed before and why?"

## Universal Closing Questions

Always end with these:
1. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
2. "Is there anything I should have asked but didn't?"
3. "Can I follow up with you in [timeframe]?"

## Questions to AVOID

- "Do you think this is a good idea?" → Opinions are worthless
- "Would you use this?" → Hypothetical, invites lying
- "How much would you pay?" → Meaningless without context
- "What features do you want?" → They don't know; that's your job
- "Do you like it?" → Fishing for compliments
- "Is this useful?" → Leading and obvious

## Questions to always keep in mind before preparing interview questions
- "What are you trying to learn from these interviews?"
- "Are you interviewing people who've already tried to solve this problem?"
- "How are you recruiting participants?"
- "What's your opening question? (Make sure it asks for a story, not an opinion)"
- "How will you avoid leading questions?"
- "What will you do with the findings?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Leading questions** - "Don't you think X would be better?" just gets agreement
- **Asking about hypotheticals** - "Would you use this?" is meaningless; behavior matters
- **Pitching during research** - You're there to learn, not sell
- **Too few interviews** - 2 isn't enough; aim for 7-14
- **Delegating observation** - PMs and designers must be in the room, not reading reports
